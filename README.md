## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Varu007/Product-Sales-Analysis-and-Dashboard.git
   cd Product-Sales-Analysis-and-Dashboard
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   Make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or Python 3.x installed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or set up the environment using an environment.yml file if provided:
   ```bash

   conda activate sales-analysis
   ```

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Open the main notebook (e.g., `Product_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter.
- Follow the instructions in each cell to run the analysis.
- Update the data file path if you use your own dataset.

## Data

- The analysis uses a sample sales dataset located in the directory.
- Dataset columns typically include: `Order ID`, `Product`, `Category`, `Quantity Ordered`, `Price Each`, `Order Date`, `City`, etc.
- You can replace the sample data with your own sales data (ensure similar column names for compatibility).

## Analysis and Visualizations

Key analyses and visualizations include:
- Monthly sales trends
- Top-selling products and categories
- Sales by city and region
- Revenue analysis
- Interactive dashboard (e.g., using Plotly, Voila, or other tools)

## Results

- The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of key metrics and trends.
- Insights can help inform inventory decisions, marketing strategies, and sales forecasting.
